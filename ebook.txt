ebook
As far as finding what you need, that "find" box can be handy and a good non fiction e-book should have a clickable contents/index/ key terms etc (like my books do). So actually if the book is set up right it can be quicker to find what you need in an e-book.? They should come up and out with a kindle or e reader that has an electronic highlighter that comes with it and pen so you can make notes/marks and save them for reference later. That too is one of the main reasons I stick to paper books. I still have a few devices to read on for ease of travel like you said but man, I would love it if they came out with something like I previously mentioned. ?
cheaper in the long run..ebooks are genrally cheaper than the physical book. some ebook platforms have unlimited access to thousands of books for a month long subscription. some of them are also listed for free.
